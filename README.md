***Details*** This is a pie chart that shows how OBP and SLG are related to OPS. OBP stands for On Base Percentage, which is the stat that calculates how often a player reaches base safely per at bat. SLG stands for Slugging Percentage, which is the stat that calculates the average amount of total bases earned per at bat. Then OPS, stands for On Base Plus Slugging, which is OBP and SLG added together and is shown in the pie chart, and an elite OPS is anything over .950.
